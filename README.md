# complaint-categorization

NOTE. Please go to our final-project branch as that is our submission for the code. This is our hackathon submission for Spend Ruby, a company revolving around purchase processing, providing services for seller and buyer end. We decided to create a complaint categorization tool that uses OpenAI's API (gpt3.5-turbo) in order to classify whether a provided JSON object is a complaint or not through analyzing its details, then summarizing and categorizing the complaint based on the theme of the complaint. We did this by parsing through each JSON object, retrieving the needed data section, then running it through our API under a fine-tuned prompt. Additionally, we used PostgreSQL to store the separate categorizations based on API generation, referencing ID number and such. Through our front-end, we developed a program to gather certain inputs from the user about a complaint to categorize within our database, also being formatted to a JSON object and saved. After that, the newly added complaint JSON object gets sent through our vector database (we used Pinecone), in order to do an augmented search for complaints that match, or are extremely similar to the newly added complaint. We had attempted to use RAG through Pinecone, using Langchain in order to classify voice clips and find complaints that match the keywords in there.
